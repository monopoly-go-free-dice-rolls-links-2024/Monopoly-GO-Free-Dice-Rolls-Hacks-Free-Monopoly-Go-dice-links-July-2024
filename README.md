Free Dice Links for Monopoly GO in July 2024
There are a ton of free dice links available in Monopoly GO, with new ones dropping nearly every day. I‚Äôve compiled a list of them for you, which you can access below, but before you get started make sure that you‚Äôre on the device that you normally play the game on. Once you‚Äôve clicked, you‚Äôll end up in the Monopoly GO app, where you can claim your reward for doing nothing at all, which is very nice. Also, there is a chance that you may sometimes receive slightly different rewards than those listed below based on your player level.
If you‚Äôve clicked on one of the above links and it‚Äôs not giving you your free dice or other reward, there are a few reasons that might be happening. Sometimes, those links have expired, and though we pull those down as fast as we can, it‚Äôs possible we‚Äôve missed one or are asleep. The older a link is, the more likely it‚Äôs expired.

Assuming the link is still active, you may have already claimed your free dice. Generally, the game will pop up a message that says ‚ÄúThis reward has already been claimed,‚Äù if that‚Äôs the case. Since these dice links are the same ones used and posted in various Monopoly GO communities, websites, and forums, it‚Äôs entirely possible you‚Äôve claimed one already. These links are made by Scopely, the company behind Monopoly GO, and are put out into the world by them.

Recent Update July 2024 (few mins earlier)‚Äã
I hit 19,999 Monopoly Go Dice Link today. Normally, I don‚Äôt make a big deal out of this stuff. But, this feels like quite an accomplishment given the dramatic shift I‚Äôve made.

It would be safe to say that six months ago, this would have been laughable. I wasn‚Äôt active on Monopoly, and I detested everything about it (and short-form video generally). But, by the end of September, I put my old man shoes away and realized that this was something I needed to do.

When I committed to it, I made a conscious decision to become the most followed account related to the topic of Facebook ads on Monopoly. I‚Äôm obviously not there yet, but this is a nice milestone.

What I did was simple and complicated at the same time. It really comes down to two things‚Ä¶

The toughest part of getting started is publishing videos into the void. Maybe it was to give me a psychological boost or to make my profile look a bit more desirable in the early going, but I ran a low level of Monopoly ads during the first couple of months.

From the time I committed to creating videos on Monopoly in October through the middle of December, I collected 3,200 followers via ads. It was a nice foundation.

This was good and bad.

The bad: I tried really hard to target precisely to build my audience with relevant people. All indications are that this wasn‚Äôt successful. It was mostly numbers padding (the relevant followers would come organically).

The good: We can knock vanity metrics all we want, but it does mean something on Monopoly if someone has a following. It surely helped convince some relevant people that I was worth following.

Did this lead to a significant spike in engagement during those first few months? Not really. But I do think that it helped me reach the next step.


A Dedicated Commitment to Create‚Äã
Look, I could run ads forever on Monopoly, but unless I was actually creating good content, it would not matter. I dedicated myself early.

I would create bad videos in the beginning, there was no avoiding that. But the goal was to get myself out of that phase as quickly as possible. I created 70 videos in October. It was a difficult, challenging, and inefficient month of video creation.

But it was worth it. I started to figure out my process. I found a workflow. Needs like software and lighting became clearer to me.

I dedicated myself to publishing at least one video per day in 2K24. Truthfully, I missed very few days once I started in October, but I wanted to avoid any days off going forward.

Monopoly Go is a reimagined version of the classic board game that's beloved around the world. The free-to-play app for Android and iOS mixes traditional elements of the almost 100 year-old game, like collecting property, building houses, and passing Go, with online multiplayer and mini-games.

To progress through Monopoly Go, you'll need plenty of Dice Rolls, which is a crucial in-game currency. Each time you want to move around the game's virtual board, you'll need to use up a Dice Roll. To get more dice, you'll have to take advantage of daily login bonuses, complete more of the game, and take part in events, among other things.

You can also spend real-life money to get more Dice, but if you'd rather not do that you can just use Monopoly Go Free Dice Links instead. Clicking on these links, which are shared each day on the app's official Instagram account, and sometimes on Facebook, will help you claim Dice Rolls entirely for free!


Monopoly Go Dice Link not working for you?‚Äã
Have you just tried claiming a Monopoly Go Dice Link and it didn't work? Dice links can only be redeemed once per Monopoly Go account, so if you click on a link and get a message that says "This reward has already been claimed" then that means you've redeemed it previously. If you get a message that says "This reward cannot be claimed" then that means the link has now expired. Keep checking back though, we are constantly updating this page with the latest links, and removing links when they stop working.


Are Monopoly Go Dice Links safe to click on?‚Äã
The Monopoly Go Dice Links that we add to this article are created by Scopely themselves, and are totally safe to click on. These links originally come from social channels like the Monopoly Go Facebook, Instagram or Discord pages.

It is, of course, a good idea to be careful about the links you click on. But the free dice links included in this article come from official sources and are safe to click on.
